This file provided a technique to detect network anomlies by supervised and unsupervised classifiers, including K-Means and Random Forest

# Dataset

CICIDS2017 datase is recognized as a popular network traffic dataset for intrusion detection challenges, which incuded varied normal and attacks
    Publicly available at: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html
    

CAN-intrusion dataset is a benchmark network security dataset for internal communication between vehicles in intrusion detection problems

Also, the surty before releasing this idea is here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpe.6894, you can find it in this file.
"Artificial intelligence empowered threat detection in the Internet of Things: A systematic review" is a comperhensive survey that provides major solutions to solve Intrusion Detection challenges after 2017. All solutions are in AI.
